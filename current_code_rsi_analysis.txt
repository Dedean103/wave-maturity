=== KEY INSIGHTS FROM RSI ANALYSIS ===

**Sequential P0 Selection Pattern:**
- All detected P0s have relatively high RSI (56.9 - 70.2)
- Current_code.py successfully finds waves when P0 is highest RSI in 50-day window
- Pattern: High RSI P0 → declining RSI through wave structure

**Why Targets Are Missing:**

1. **2024-03-11 (Target P0 RSI 76.9)**: 
   - Window 25 (2024-02-20 to 2024-04-09) selected 2024-02-28 (RSI 87.3) instead
   - Target RSI 76.9 was high but not the window maximum

2. **2024-07-28 (Target P0 RSI 57.8)**: 
   - Window 32 (2024-07-19 to 2024-09-06) selected 2024-07-21 (RSI 67.7) instead  
   - Target RSI 57.8 was only moderate, clearly not window maximum

**Conclusion:**
Sequential approach only captures waves starting from window-maximum RSI peaks, missing valid patterns that start from non-maximum (but still significant) RSI levels. The comprehensive approach tests all RSI extrema regardless of their ranking within arbitrary time windows.
